            <h2>Curve FAQ</h2>
            <h3>What is Curve?</h3>

            <p>Curve is an exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum (like <a
             href="https://uniswap.exchange/">Uniswap</a>)
            designed for (1) extremely efficient stablecoin trading (2) low
            risk, supplemental fee income for liquidity providers, without an
            opportunity cost.</p>

            <p>Curve allows users (and smart contracts like <a href="https://1inch.exchange/">1inch</a> or
            <a href="https://paraswap.io/">Paraswap</a>) to trade
            between DAI and USDC with a bespoke low slippage, low fee algorithm
            designed specifically for stablecoins. Behind the scenes, the
            liquidity pool is supplied to the <a href="https://compound.finance/">Compound</a> protocol, where it
            generates income for liquidity providers.</p>

            <h3>Has Curve been audited?</h3>
            <p>Curve is currently in alpha - the codebase can be found
            <a href="https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/tree/compounded">on GitHub</a>.
            Please donâ€™t supply your life savings, or assets you
            canâ€™t afford to lose, to Curve, especially as a liquidity
            provider.</p>

            <p>Using Curve as an exchange user should be significantly less
            risky, but this is not advice.</p>

            <h3>How do I trade on Curve?</h3>
            <p>Before trading, youâ€™ll have to approve Curve to interact with
            your DAI or USDC balance, similar to most DeFi applications.</p>

            <p>On the <a href="/">exchange</a>, select the asset you would like to convert (e.g.
            USDC), and the quantity (e.g. 1,000) - the exchange rate, and
            quantity that you will receive (including and all slippage and fees)
            will be displayed. The exchange rate might surprise you - thatâ€™s the
            power of Curve.</p>

            <h3>How do I provide liquidity to Curve?</h3>

            <p>Curve uses <a href="https://compound.finance/ctokens">cTokens</a>,
            assets inside the Compound protocol, as the
            liquidity pool - this ensures that assets are always being put to
            work. You can acquire cDAI or cUSDC by supplying DAI or USDC to
            <a href="https://app.compound.finance/">Compound</a>, or by
            acquiring cTokens on <a href="https://1inch.exchange/">1inch</a>
            or <a href="https://paraswap.io/">Paraswap</a>.</p>

            <p>Before providing liquidity, youâ€™ll have to approve Curve to
            interact with your cDAI or cUSDC balances.</p>

            <p>Visit the <a href="/deposit.html">Curve deposit page</a>, and your available balances should
            appear. If you <b>add all coins in a balanced proportion</b>, you will
            provide cTokens at the current exchange Curve rate; this requires
            you to have both assets in your wallet. You can uncheck this feature
            to supply one side of the market, or a different ratio of assets,
            and Curve will automatically exchange them into the proper quantity
            (with the same low slippage & fees of the Curve exchange) -
            magic!</p>

            <h3>What's "Use maximum amount of coins available"?</h3>
            <p>This means using all USDC and DAI in your wallet. This way is
            recommended only if you have much less coins than currently in
            liquidity pool.</p>

            <h3>How to withdraw liquidity I provided?</h3>
            <p>Go to <a href="/withdraw.html">the withdraw page</a>. If you want
            to withdraw some percentage of your liquidity (the preferred way),
            type that percentage in the top field.
            You can, however, withdraw in a form of individual coins (USDC,
            DAI), having the exchange happening for you, if you type amounts in
            lower fields. You'll get charged with the exchange fee in the latter
            case.</p>
