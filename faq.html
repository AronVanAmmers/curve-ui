            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3>What is Curve.fi?</h3>
            <p>Curve.fi is a set of smart contracts which create on-chain
            liquidity for stablecoins in a very efficient, autonomous way.
            That means smaller price slippage for traders and higher profits for
            liquidity providers.</p>

            <h3>How to trade?</h3>
            <p>Just go to <a href="/">the exchange page</a> and do it! For now,
            you can exchange between DAI and USDC, there will be more currencies
            in nearest future.</p>

            <h3>How to use Curve.fi for profit?</h3>
            <p>Go to <a href="/deposit.html">the deposit page</a> and add some
            cDAI / cUSDC. For that, supply some DAI / USDC, deposit on
            <a href="https://app.compound.finance/">Compound Protocol</a>. Then,
            you'll be able to deposit DAI and USDC which are getting interest on
            Compound. So you can earn trading fees and compounded interest at
            the same time!</p>

            <h3>What's "Add all coins in a balanced proportion"?</h3>
            <p>When you are typing, how many coins to add, you need to add them
            in the same proportion as the current pool. If you don't get that
            option checked, you will automatically exchange your coins to be in
            balance, which is recommended if you are adding a significantly
            smaller amount than the current liquidity.</p>

            <h3>What's "Use maximum amount of coins available"?</h3>
            <p>This means using all USDC and DAI in your wallet. This way is
            recommended only if you have much less coins than currently in
            liquidity pool.</p>

            <h3>How to withdraw liquidity I provided</h3>
            <p>Go to <a href="/withdraw.html">the withdraw page</a>. If you want
            to withdraw some percentage of your liquidity (the preferred way),
            type that percentage in the top field.
            You can, however, withdraw in a form of individual coins (USDC,
            DAI), having the exchange happening for you, if you type amounts in
            lower fields. You'll get charge with the exchange fee in the latter
            case.</p>
